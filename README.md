# 702 Webmail Client

This project was created to test the different timing to invoke a chatbot within a webmail client to minimise annoyance, while maximising learning about phishing. It is created using React, Typescript, Vite, Redux-toolkit, and CSS3. The chatbot is implemented using BotPress, utilising their prebuilt react chatbot component.

**NOTE:** The close button on the chatbot window does not currently work, it is an issue with BotPress's component.
